;;; The 'cluerun' script invokes sbcl. The arguments are:
;;;  * the engine name (always 'sbcl')
;;;  * all the input files
;;;  * "--"
;;;  * user arguments, if any

;;; We have to pull in the runtime and C library and then all the input
;;; files. At that point we can run the user's program.

;;; *posix-argv* is our argv array (first element is sbcl's executable name)

;;; We could disable the sbcl debugger here
