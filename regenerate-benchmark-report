These are the benchmark results that are produced by my computer.

The Computer Language Benchmark Game benchmarks. These should be considered
unit tests only --- the numbers are not indicative of anything in particular.
The time column indicates the absolute time in seconds; the comparison
factor indicates the time taken as a multiple of the time gcc took. So
1 means the same time, 2 means twice as long, etc. Times include working time
only, and not load and startup time, which would be considerable for some
targets (such as c, which involves compiling the target program with gcc).
