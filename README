INTRODUCTION
============

Clue is an experimental C compiler for Lua, Javascript and Perl. It compiles,
eventually, ANSI C programs into a form which may be run on a standard Lua,
Javascript or Perl 5 interpreter.

Clue is EXPERIMENTAL and UNFINISHED. It is not suitable for any kind of
production use. There are a number of C language features that are not
implemented yet, and it produces rather bad code. However, it will compile
a large number of non-trivial programs.



INSTALLATION
============

Installation is unfortunately rather involved and will only work on Unix-like
systems. I develop on Linux. You *may* be able to make it all work on Cygwin
but you're on your own. Sorry.

TO RUN PROGRAMS BUILT WITH THE LUA BACK END:
   ...you will need a Lua 5.1.3 interpreter (such as the stock Lua or Mike
   Pall's LuaJIT) with the LuaSocket and BitLib modules installed.

TO RUN PROGRAMS BUILT WITH THE JAVASCRIPT BACK END:
   ...you will need a command-line Javascript interpreter such as SpiderMonkey
   or Rhino.

TO RUN PROGRAMS BUILT WITH THE PERL5 BACK END:
   ...you will need a Perl 5 interpreter with the Time::Hires module (which
   is normally installed automatically).
   
TO BUILD THE COMPILER:
   
1. Fetch sparse 0.4.1 from here:

     http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/devel/sparse/

   Apply the supplied sparse.patch file, compile it, and install it.    

2. Edit the supplied pmfile and change the section at the top to point
   at where you installed sparse's headers and libraries.
   
3. Do:

     ./pm
     
   Clue will then build the compiler and the modified Lua interpreter that's
   used as an assembler.
   
Clue is currently not designed to be installed anywhere; it should be run from
the place where you built it. I did warn you it was experimental...


USAGE
=====

You may compile a C program as follows:

	bin/clue -m<backend> test/helloworld.c > output.<backend>
	
<backend> may be lua, js or perl5.
   
This will read in the source file, compile it and write out the result.

IMPORTANT NOTE: if you're using the Lua back end, the resulting files *will
not work*. They need processing with the supplied Lua 'assembler' to make the
GOTO statements within them work properly. The cluebat script is a simple tool
to do this for you; use 'cluebat test/helloworld.c output.luac' to compile,
process and assemble a file.

Once you have a runnable result, you may run it with the cluerun tool. This
sets up the run-time environment needed to run Clue code.

    ./cluerun -f output.luac
or  ./cluerun -f output.js
or  ./cluerun -f output.pl

By default, cluerun will try to use LuaJIT for .luac files, SpiderMonkey
for .js files and Perl 5 for .pl files. You can change this with the -e
option, which may have one of the following values:

    lua       standard Lua interpreter
    luajit    Mike Pall's LuaJIT
    smjs      SpiderMonkey Javascript interpreter
    rhino     Rhino Javascript interpreter
    perl5     Perl 5 interpreter

You can pass arguments to the Clue program by suffixing cluerun with a --.

    ./cluerun -e rhino -f output.js -- arg1 arg2 arg3

You may use multiple files --- all of the same type, of course --- and they
will get linked together and main() run.

    ./cluerun -e rhino -f file1.js -f file2.js -f file3.js -- arg1 arg2 arg3   

However, this is currently untested. (sparse has some bugs that cause
prototyping symbols to sometimes not work correctly.)


BENCHMARKING
============

Clue is complete enough to run a number of benchmarks. These are located
in the test directory.

Most of the benchmarks are taken from the Computer Language Benchmark
Game (ne√© the Great Computer Language Shootout), located here:

    http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/
    
The CLBG benchmarks can be run en mass using the supplied run-benchmarks
script. It will run each benchmark using gcc, clue via a Lua interpreter,
and clue via LuaJIT (if you have it). (Note that the script does *not*
use the same number of iterations as the CLBG uses, as I'm not getting
any younger.)

Also supplied is a version of the very elderly Whetstone benchmark. This
can be run as a normal program.

See README.benchmarks for the results I get on my machine.


WRITING PROGRAMS WITH CLUE
==========================

Clue supports standard ANSI C (C89, some C99, some bugs). Unfortunately,
most programmers don't! There are a number of places where Clue behaves
very differently to normal C compilers, 

- you may not cast any kind of pointer to a number, or vice
  versa (except for the special case of constant 0, which may be
  cast to any kind of pointer).
  
- you may not cast function pointers to object pointers or vice
  versa.
 
- accessing memory via the wrong kind of pointer is not supported. This
  means you can't do this:
  
  {
    void* p = &fnord;
    return *(int*)p;
  }
  
  You *can* use unions to store two objects of different types at the same
  memory location --- but accessing the wrong one will probably produce a
  runtime error.
  
- sizeof(char) == sizeof(int) == sizeof(long) == sizeof(void(*)()) == 1.
  sizeof(void*) == 2.

- trying to operate on uninitialised memory will most likely produce a
  runtime error (as it gets initialised to the Lua value nil, which you
  can't do things like arithmetic operations on). 

- the libc is *very* terse. I implemented only those functions necessary
  to make the benchmarks work.

Violating any of these will sometimes produce a compile-time error but
mostly you'll get a really, really strange run-time error.


BUGS
====

Hahahaha! Hahahahahaha! Haha!

Okay, there are some bugs. Did I mention this was experimental?

The ones I've actually noticed include, but are not limited to:

Compiler bugs:

- inline doesn't work.

- Multiple declarations of items doesn't work. (This is a sparse bug.)

- Various compiler features aren't implemented yet, like switch or varargs.

Libc bugs:

- stdio can only read or write text on Lua; this causes clbg-mandelbrot to
  produce invalid data when run using clue.
  
- printf is very basic and doesn't properly implement the printf spec
  (different on each platform); for example, Lua can't handle the l modifier
  and produces a run-time error if it sees one.

There are others. Oh, yes, there are others.
  

TODO
====

There are a number of ways to take Clue further.

- Target Lua bytecode directly, rather than producing Lua source and then
  compiling it and postprocessing it. This will prevent a lot of useless
  bytecode being produced, so making things faster.
   
- Finish the language coverage. There are a number of C language features
  that I haven't gotten around to doing (like switch).  


LICENSING
=========

Different parts of the supplied source are covered by different licenses.

src/lua-goto contains a copy of the Lua 5.1.3 source code patched with a
tweaked version of Luiz Henrique de Figueiredo's GOTO patch. This is used
solely for assembling clue's output and not for running any code. These are
covered by the MIT license. See the end of src/lua-goto/lua.h for the text.

test/clbg-*.c are very slightly tweaked (mostly changing %ld to %d in
format strings) versions of the Computer Language Benchmark Game
benchmarks. See http://shootout.alioth.debian.org. These are covered by the
Revised BSD license. See
http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/gp4/miscfile.php?file=license&title=revised%20BSD%20license
for the text.

test/whetstone.c is a hacked copy of one of the million or so Whetstone
variations dating from the 1980s. It is, I believe, public domain. If anyone
has more information, please get in touch.

Practically everything else was written by me, David Given, and is covered by
the three-clause BSD license. The text follows:
