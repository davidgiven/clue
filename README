INTRODUCTION
============

Clue is an experimental C compiler for Lua, Javascript, Perl, Common Lisp,
Java, and C. It compiles, eventually, ANSI C programs into a form which may
be run on a standard runtime for any of these languages.

Clue is EXPERIMENTAL and UNFINISHED. It is not suitable for any kind of
production use. There are a number of C language features that are not
implemented yet, and it produces rather bad code. However, it will compile
a large number of non-trivial programs.



INSTALLATION
============

Installation is unfortunately rather involved and will only work on Unix-like
systems. I develop on Linux. You *may* be able to make it all work on Cygwin
but you're on your own. Sorry.

TO RUN PROGRAMS BUILT WITH THE LUA BACK END:
   ...you will need a Lua 5.1.3 interpreter (such as the stock Lua or Mike
   Pall's LuaJIT) with the LuaSocket and BitLib modules installed.

TO RUN PROGRAMS BUILT WITH THE JAVASCRIPT BACK END:
   ...you will need a command-line Javascript interpreter such as SpiderMonkey
   or Rhino.

TO RUN PROGRAMS BUILT WITH THE PERL5 BACK END:
   ...you will need a Perl 5 interpreter with the Time::Hires module (which
   is normally installed automatically).

TO RUN PROGRAMS BUILT WITH THE COMMON LISP BACK END:
   ...you will need a copy of the SBCL Common Lisp environment. It may or
   may not work with other Common Lisp systems.
   ...thanks to Peter Maydell (http://sourceforge.net/users/pm215) for
   contributing this.
   
TO RUN PROGRAMS BUILT WITH THE C BACK END:
   ...you will need a C toolchain --- but then if you can build Clue, you
   will already have one.

TO RUN PROGRAMS BUILT WITH THE JAVA BACK END:
   ...you will need a JDK. Clue generates class files by producing Java source
   code and compiling it, so you'll need a javac as well as a java interpreter.
   I develop with the official Sun Java 6 distribution.
         
TO BUILD THE COMPILER:
   
1. Fetch sparse 0.4.1 from here:

     http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/devel/sparse/

   Apply the supplied sparse.patch file, compile it, and install it.    

2. Edit the supplied pmfile and change the section at the top to point
   at where you installed sparse's headers and libraries.
   
3. Do:

     ./pm

   Clue will then build the compiler and the modified Lua interpreter that's
   used as an assembler.
   
Clue is currently not designed to be installed anywhere; it should be run from
the place where you built it. I did warn you it was experimental...



USAGE
=====

You may compile a C program as follows:

	bin/clue -m<backend> test/helloworld.c > output.<extension>
	
<backend> may be lua, js, perl5, java or c. <extension> is normally the same
as the backend, except for Java, which should use j.
   
This will read in the source file, compile it and write out the result.

Once you have a runnable result, you may run it with the cluerun tool. This
sets up the run-time environment needed to run Clue code.

    ./cluerun -f output.lua
or  ./cluerun -f output.js
or  ./cluerun -f output.pl
or  ./cluerun -f output.lisp
or  ./cluerun -f output.j
or  ./cluerun -f output.c

By default, cluerun will try to use LuaJIT for .lua files, SpiderMonkey
for .js files and Perl 5 for .pl files. You can change this with the -e
option, which may have one of the following values:

    lua       standard Lua interpreter
    luajit    Mike Pall's LuaJIT
    smjs      SpiderMonkey Javascript interpreter
    rhino     Rhino Javascript interpreter
    perl5     Perl 5 interpreter
    lisp      SBCL Common Lisp interpreter
    j         standard Java compiler and interpreter
    c         C compiler via gcc

You can pass arguments to the Clue program by suffixing cluerun with a --.

    ./cluerun -e rhino -f output.js -- arg1 arg2 arg3

You may use multiple files --- all of the same type, of course --- and they
will get linked together and main() run.

    ./cluerun -e rhino -f file1.js -f file2.js -f file3.js -- arg1 arg2 arg3   

This works to a certain extent (it's used by the benchmarks), but is still a
bit problematic. (sparse has some bugs that cause prototyping symbols to
sometimes not work correctly.)



BENCHMARKING
============

Clue is complete enough to run a number of benchmarks. These are located
in the test directory.

Most of the benchmarks are taken from the Computer Language Benchmark
Game (ne√© the Great Computer Language Shootout), located here:

    http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/
    
The CLBG benchmarks can be run en mass using the supplied run-benchmarks
script. It will run each benchmark using gcc, clue via a Lua interpreter,
and clue via LuaJIT (if you have it). (Note that the script does *not*
use the same number of iterations as the CLBG uses, as I'm not getting
any younger.) However, the CLBG benchmarks are very inaccurate and they
should be considered unit tests only.

Also supplied is a version of the very elderly Whetstone benchmark. This
can be run as a normal program.

See README.benchmarks for the results I get on my machine.



WRITING PROGRAMS WITH CLUE
==========================

Clue supports standard ANSI C (C89, some C99, some bugs). Unfortunately,
most programmers don't! There are a number of places where Clue behaves
very differently to normal C compilers, 

- you may not cast any kind of pointer to a number, or vice
  versa (except for the special case of constant 0, which may be
  cast to any kind of pointer).
  
- you may not cast function pointers to object pointers or vice
  versa.
 
- accessing memory via the wrong kind of pointer is not supported. This
  means you can't do this:
  
  {
    void* p = &fnord;
    return *(int*)p;
  }
  
  You *can* use unions to store two objects of different types at the same
  memory location --- but accessing the wrong one will probably produce a
  runtime error.
  
- sizeof(char) == sizeof(int) == sizeof(long) == sizeof(void(*)()) == 1.
  sizeof(void*) == 2.

- trying to operate on uninitialised memory will most likely produce a
  runtime error (as it will probably be initialised to something that you
  can't do things like arithmetic operations on). 

- the libc is *very* terse. I implemented only those functions necessary
  to make the benchmarks work.

Violating any of these will sometimes produce a compile-time error but
mostly you'll get a really, really strange run-time error.



BUGS
====

Hahahaha! Hahahahahaha! Haha!

Okay, there are some bugs. Did I mention this was experimental?

The ones I've actually noticed include, but are not limited to:

Compiler bugs:

- inline doesn't work.

- Multiple declarations of items doesn't work. (This is a sparse bug.)

- sparse can't always distinguish between different scalar types of the same
  size, which means that backends can't distinguish between reals and integers;
  this usually manifests itself in parameters being passed to functions in the
  wrong register. This means that backends must use the same type to represent
  both reals and integers, which prevents certain optimisations in c and java.
  (This is a sparse bug.)
  
- Various compiler features aren't implemented yet, like switch or varargs.

Libc bugs:

- stdio can only read or write text on Lua; this causes clbg-mandelbrot to
  produce invalid data when run using clue.
  
- printf is very basic and doesn't properly implement the printf spec
  (different on each platform).
  
- the Common Lisp libc is only partially implemented, which means that the
  benchmarks aren't run for it. 

There are others. Oh, yes, there are others.
  


TODO
====

There are a number of ways to take Clue further.

- Add more targets. I'd like the Java target to emit bytecode; that way we
  get a real goto implementation, which should boost performance. There's
  also an experimental Common Lisp target that was contributed that needs a
  libc to be useful. 
   
- Finish the language coverage. There are a number of C language features
  that I haven't gotten around to doing (like switch).
